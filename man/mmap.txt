NAME
	mmap

SYNOPSIS
	state_t mmap(void * vmem_start, void * pmem_start, size_t length, int * status)

DESCRIPTION
	mmap maps a physical address range into the current vitual address space. 
	It can either map a set physical address range or the next availible one.

OPTIONS
	void * vmem_start
		The virtual memory address to start mapping from. This address must 
		be 4KB aligned.
	void * pmem_start
		The physical memory address to start mapping from. This address must 
		be 4KB aligned. If this is NULL, then instead of a set range, the next
		availible page is mapped.
	size_t length
		The length (in bytes) to map. This should be a multiple of 4KB. If not, 
		it is rounded up.
	int * status
		This field currently does nothing.
