NAME
        hexdump

SYNOPSIS
        void hexdump(void* data, uint32_t length, uint32_t bytes_per_line)

DESCRIPTION
        Hexdump is a utility to print out data in a human readable format. It 
        prints the address offset into the data pointer, the hex representation
        of the data, as well as the ASCII conversion, converting unprintable 
        characters to period ('.') character.

OPTIONS
        void* data
            Pointer to data to be output
        uint32_t length
            Length in bytes of data
        uint32_t bytes_per_line
            Number of bytes to print per line. Multiples of 8 will look best, 
            with 16 being recommended (as it will match hd on linux and 
            wireshark's default)
