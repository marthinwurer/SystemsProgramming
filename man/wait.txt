NAME
        wait

SYNOPSIS
        status_t wait(
                pid_t *pid,
                int32_t *status
        )

DESCRIPTION
        The wait system call blocks the current process until a specified
        child process terminates. If the current process has no children then
        an error code is returned. If the current process has at least one
        child that has not been cleaned up yet, that child will be cleaned
        and its status will be returned. Otherwise the process will block until
        a child terminates.

OPTIONS
        pid
            If successful, will be set to the PID of the child
        status
            If successful, will be set to the exit code of the child
