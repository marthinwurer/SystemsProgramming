SYNOPSIS
        void sleep( uint32_t msec )

DESCRIPTION
        The sleep system call puts the current process to sleep for
        the given amount of milleseconds. The process will be blocked for
        at least msec milleseconds, the actual amount of time spent sleeping
        depends on the scheduler. If msec is 0, then the process will give up
        its time slice and the scheduler will dispatch the next process.

OPTIONS

            The amount of time, in milleseconds, for the current process to
            sleep for.
