NAME
        send_packet

SYNOPSIS
        int32_t send_packet(uint8_t dst_hw_addr[], void* data, uint16_t length, 
                ethertype_t ethertype)

DESCRIPTION
        Sends an ethernet frame without any inner headers. Can be layered to use
        with different Internet layer protocols. 

OPTIONS
        uint8_t dst_hw_addr[]
            Destination mac address 
        void* data
            Data to send
        uint16_t length
            Length of the data to send
        ethertype_t ethertype
            Ethertype to use with the frame (defined in kern/net/intel.h). This
            indicates what the inner packet protocol is (IP, ARP, etc), or the
            length of the ethernet frame if the value is under 1500. If using a
            length value, it must be in network byte order (big endian).
